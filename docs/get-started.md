## Prerequisites

Python 3.6.7+


## Installation

You can install stream-zip from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/stream-zip/) using pip.

```shell
pip install stream-zip
```

This installs the latest version of stream-zip.

If you regularly install stream-zip, such as during application deployment, to avoid unexpected changes as new versions are released, you can pin to a specific version. [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) or [pip-tools](https://pip-tools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) are popular tools that can be used for this.


## ZIP files

Some understanding of ZIP files is needed to use stream-zip. A ZIP file is a collection of member files, where each member file has 5 properties.

1. File name
2. Modification time
3. Mode (File type and permissions)
4. Method (Compression mechanism)
5. Binary contents

stream-unzip does not offer defaults for any of these 5 properties.


## Basic usage

A single function is exposed, `stream_zip`. This function takes an iterable of member files, and returns an iterable yielding the bytes of the ZIP file. Each member file must be a tuple of the above 5 properties.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from stat import S_IFREG
from stream_zip import ZIP_32, stream_zip

member_files = (
    (
        'my-file-1.txt',     # File name
        datetime.now(),      # Modification time
        S_IFREG | 0o600,     # Mode - regular file that owner can read and write
        ZIP_32,              # ZIP_32 has good support but limited to 4GiB
        (b'Some bytes 1',),  # Iterable of chunks of contents
    ),
    (
        'my-file-2.txt',
        datetime.now(),
        S_IFREG | 0o600,
        ZIP_32,
        (b'Some bytes 2',),
    ),
)
zipped_chunks = stream_zip(member_files):

for zipped_chunk in zipped_chunks:
    print(zipped_chunk)
```

## Generators

In the above example `member_files` is a tuple. However, any iterable that yields tuples can be used, for example a generator.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from stat import S_IFREG
from stream_zip import ZIP_32, stream_zip

def member_files():
    modified_at = datetime.now()
    mode = S_IFREG | 0o600
    yield ('my-file-1.txt', modified_at, mode, ZIP_32, (b'Some bytes 1',))
    yield ('my-file-2.txt', modified_at, mode, ZIP_32, (b'Some bytes 2',))

zipped_chunks = stream_zip(member_files()):

for zipped_chunk in zipped_chunks:
    print(zipped_chunk)
```

Each iterable of binary chunks of file contents could itself be a generator.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from stat import S_IFREG
from stream_zip import ZIP_32, stream_zip

def member_files():
    modified_at = datetime.now()
    mode = S_IFREG | 0o600

    def file_1_data():
        yield b'Some bytes 1'

    def file_2_data():
        yield b'Some bytes 2'

    yield ('my-file-1.txt', modified_at, mode, ZIP_32, file_1_data())
    yield ('my-file-2.txt', modified_at, mode, ZIP_32, file_2_data())

zipped_chunks = stream_zip(member_files()):

for zipped_chunk in zipped_chunks:
    print(zipped_chunk)
```

This pattern of generators is typical for stream-unzip. Depending on how the generators are defined, it allows avoiding loading all the bytes of member files into memory at once.


## Symbolic links

Symbolic links can be stored in ZIP files. The mode must have `stat.S_IFLNK`, and the binary contents of the file must be the path to the target of the symbolic link.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from stat import S_IFLNK
from stream_zip import ZIP_32

link = ('source.txt', datetime.now(), S_IFLNK | 0o600, ZIP_32, (b'target.txt',))
```


## Directories

Directories can be stored in ZIP files as empty member files whose name ends with a forward slash `/` that also have `stat.S_IFDIR` in the mode.

```python
from datetime import datetime
from stat import S_IFDIR
from stream_zip import ZIP_32

directory = ('my-dir/', datetime.now(), S_IFDIR | 0o700, ZIP_32, ())
```

The `stat.S_IFDIR` on the file is technically optional, but is probably good practice since it will match the resulting directory after extraction. The permissions on the directory, in the above case `0o700`, are not preserved by all clients on extraction.

It is not required to have a directory member file in order to have files in that directory. So this pattern is most useful to have empty directories in the ZIP.


## Methods

Each member file is compressed with a method that must be specified in client code. See [Methods](/methods/) for an explanation of each.


## Stream unzipping

In general, not all valid ZIP files are possible to be stream unzipped. However, all files generated by stream-zip are suitable for stream unzipping, for example by [stream-unzip](https://stream-unzip.docs.trade.gov.uk/).
